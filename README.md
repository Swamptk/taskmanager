# Task Manager CLI

-------------

Task is a simple task manager for your console, made in Go following the 7th [gophercise](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses) by [Jon Calhoun](https://twitter.com/joncalhoun). This app implements the features that Calhoun adds as a bonus to this exercise, so it might serve as help for the ones who don't know how to do it.

## Message from the author

>The way I implemented those features is probably not the best, so I encourage any kind of constructive criticism.

>At the same time, it is an exercise for getting used to Github and Git, since this is the first repository I make public. As a result, this is more of an exercise for myself than a proper submit, so again, I would appreciate any kind of tip or advice.

## Status of the Project

The project should be fully functioning and every feature listed below should work properly. That being said, there may be cases that could crash the program since I have not tested it completely.
